# Interplanetary Banhammer

Now discontinued, this was a partnership effort initiated several large Discord servers, including r/Google, r/Apple, and several others. The goal was to enhance our moderation outreach by sharing banned users' IDs among other partners, so that we could punish trolls, raiders and spammers to great effect. The estimated outreach was around 100,000 unique Discord users. This site was created to serve as an information hub and disclaimer for users joining servers part of IBH.
